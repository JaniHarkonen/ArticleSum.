### Timeline.js
- separate mouse cursor to another canvas
- separate cursor logic to another useEffect
- make Timeline more general so that it is capable of displaying data other than dates
- remove CAN and DIV
- make Timeline and its subcomponents less dependent on Article

### General
- improve encapsulation by paying attention to dependencies, such as between component and Article
- look to utilize React-fragmens as often as possible
